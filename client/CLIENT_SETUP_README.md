## Client Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions to set up the client side of the project.

## Steps

1. **Open the client folder:**

    ```sh
    cd client
    ```

2. **Add the .env details:**

    Create a `.env` file in the client folder and add the necessary environment variables.

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

## Build and Run

Sometimes development run may felt very slow and irresponsive. In that case, you can build the client and run the server.

1. **Build the client:**

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

2. **Run the server:**

    ```sh
    npm run preview
    ```

Update `.env` with the new port number.

## Admin Panel

Go to `CLIENT_URL/admin/` to access the admin panel. Use the superuser credentials created during the server setup to log in.
